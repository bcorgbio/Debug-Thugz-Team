# Introduction

The main theme of the project is to assess the morphological and allometric differences between different ecomorphs within the genus *Anolis*. A recent study by @hagey2017there studied the hindlimb-ecomorph relationship in anoles. So, this project will determine if ecomorph is an important predictor of the hindlimb-SVL (snout-vent length) relationship in anoles by using phylogenetic least squares analysis to assess this relationship under Brownian motion and OU models of trait evolution.

# Methods

To answer the question, two simple linear models were constructed that assess the effect of perch diameter and height, and the residuals of these models were plotted against ecomorph. Then, phylogenetic least squares models of hindlimb-SVL relationships with perch diameter and height were constructed based on the phylogenetic tree data [@poe2017phylogenetic]. Each models fit was assessed with AICc and AICw to determine if one or both was a significant predictor of hindlimb length in a phylogenetic context.


# Results

The results of this experiment showed that both perch height and diameter combined are significant predictors of hindlimb length in a phylogenetic context. Additionally, it was determined that ecomorph was an important predictor of the hindlimb-SVL relationship in anoles.

```






# Discussion

The finding that ecomorph was an important predictor of the hindlimb-SVL relationship in anoles answers the initial question and is important because it shows that the ecological parameters of perch height and perch diameter predict discrete patterns in the hindlimb-SVL relationship.
